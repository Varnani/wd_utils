## **wd_utils**
A Python 2.7 utility for creating inputs and reading outputs from Wilson - Devinney (WD) eclipsing binary modelling code.

### Important! ###
wd_utils is not meant to be used as a stand-alone scripter for Wilson - Devinney code. 
It was developed for PyWD2015's WD backend and shared here without any promises of support or continued development. 
You are encouraged to use either PyWD2015 or Phoebe 2.0 with WD backend.

However, if you are feeling adventurous, take a look at example files. Source code has limited documentation available.
